## Real World Human-AI XRPL Multi-blockchain Network
In the real world innovators require the best tech to get the job done in the continuously evolving geopolitical human-AI environmental-technical ecosystem. Especially to overcome growing pains as described where [Pentagon paper warns of major vulnerabilities in the Bitcoin and Ethereum blockchains](https://finbold.com/pentagon-paper-warns-of-major-vulnerabilities-in-the-bitcoin-blockchain/)

The `XRP Ledger` is the world's first proof of consensus blockchain, encoded by the original Bitcoin proof of work developers as an upgrade from [Bitcoin's inefficiencies and inability to scale](https://finbold.com/pentagon-paper-warns-of-major-vulnerabilities-in-the-bitcoin-blockchain/), operating without fail since 2012 via distributed network of global validators. Thus the `XRP Ledger` has established itself as a necessary `public good` in essentially forming a vital external organ interconnecting the human-AI technical ecosystem of the Industry 4.0 information-monetization revolution partial sovereign-banking jurisdictional transference to the blockchains. 

Accordingly, smart contracts and NFTs are all the rage for their highly anticipated as yet unrealized potential value in the **emerging global multi-blockchain critical infrastructure network**. The present Web3 IPO XRPL MATIC SOLO Hooks SmartContract{SmartNFTshares} Network project creates a real world solution to the Ethereum scaling and multi-blockchain interoperability problems, including improved cross-blockchain transaction tracking amid the exponential increases in sovereign fiat-cryptocurrency **transaction densities**, as indicated in the review [Consortium Blockchains: Overview, Applications and Challenges](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/328887130_Consortium_Blockchains_Overview_Applications_and_Challenges).

## Web3 Startup IPO SmartContract{SmartNFTshares} Template
The present Smart Contract{SmartNFTshares} Network design schema starts with the conventional domain [worldblockchaincomputer.org](https://worldblockchaincomputer.org/) website, wherein the **Unstoppable Domains** human-readable crypto address worldblockchaincomputer.crypto is minted by **Polygon-MATIC** to redirect human-readable crypto entries to the machine-readable crypto wallet addresses of the multi-blockchains. The SmartContract{SmartNFTshares} Network is then formed by compound-minting the {.org .crypto} domains on the `XRP Ledger` via the **SologenicDEX** decentralized exchange into SOLO NFTshares with the same XRP wallet address as the {.crypto .nft ... .x} redirect list.

Human-readable to machine-readable redirects are the key to **web3** interoperability, wherein payments on web3 sites recognize the human-readable addresses including ** XRP USDC MATIC XLM ZIL HBAR XDC  BTC LTC ETH QNT** or any of the **[sovereign CBDCs under development](https://twitter.com/IMFNews/status/1529220829271060480)**. 

**Hosting of the [Hooks smart contract transactions](https://xrpl-hooks.readme.io/docs/examples)** is via the {.org .crypto .nft ... .x} domains in conjunction with the **[XRP Stamp Data notarization file system](https://xrpstamp.com)**. Thus the record of transaction addresses form a trusted network.

According to the [Hooks - Smart Contract proposal for the XRP Ledger](https://xrpl-hooks.readme.io) wherein [Developers Can Now Build Layer-1 Smart Contracts on Ripple’s XRP Ledger](https://thecryptobasic.com/2022/07/09/developers-can-now-build-layer-1-smart-contracts-on-ripples-xrp-ledger/), wherein "It is noteworthy that developers can write Hooks code in any programming language." 

Consequently, the [XRP Ledger](https://xrpl.org/get-started-using-javascript.html) based exchanges such as SologenicDEX, GateHub, Bitrue, et al, can provide fast, efficient, and secure **XRP USDC CBDC bridging transactions** necessary to the sovereign-fiat central banking networks.

When SmartNFTshares are sold on the Sologenic DEX the "name":"worldblockchaincomputer{.org .crypto} SmartContract{Smart NFTs} #0000001" metadata of course always connects the Smart NFT to the corporate https & blockchain addresses when the Smart NFT is bought & sold, while the current wallet "address" can be searched prior to any SmartNFTshareholder transaction.

Note in order to create a minimal working template that can be sold on **OpenSea** with minimal complications only one worldblockchaincomputer{.org .crypto} NFT share has been minted and still owned by the worldblockchaincomputer.crypto XRP wallet address.

Detection of Polygon-EVM related smart contract-related events can them be monitored, for example, by the **[Moralis Smart Contract Event APIs](https://docs.moralis.io/moralis-dapp/automatic-transaction-sync/smart-contract-events)**. 

Hence the present SOLUTION to the Bitcoin and Ethereum SCALING PROBLEM [minimizes the need for the expensive deal-breaking Ethereum-Layer 2 BRIDGING FEES as described by Forbes](https://www.forbes.com/sites/investor/2021/11/15/ethereum-the-640-billion-dollar-question/?sh=62e53fc6857d). Wherein despite the promised Ethereum 2.0.0 upgrades the situation has only gotten worse over time [Ethereum Gas Prices Continue To Soar Due To Stablecoin Transactions](https://procoinnews.com/ethereum-gas-prices-continue-to-soar-due-to-stablecoin-transactions/).

## Tracking Multi-blockchain Smart Contract Events
TigerGraph really helps to interactively visualize the Web3 IPO XRPL MATIC-SOLO Hooks SmartContract{SmartNFTshares} Network design schema and track its cross-blockchain transaction histories, starting with the original wallet ownership of the XRPL MATIC-SOLO Hooks SmartContract{SmartNFTshares}. 

Initiation of any dividend payment, escrow, payment channel, or any other transaction is of course via smart contract event, which TigerGraph can track via [Polygonscan](https://docs.moralis.io/moralis-dapp/sending-assets) and [Moralis Transaction History APIs](https://docs.moralis.io/moralis-dapp/automatic-transaction-sync/historical-transactions). Accordingly, a TigerGraph GSQL query of SmartContract{SmartNFTshares} `metadata.json` could be made along the lines of:

```CREATE QUERY FindNFTshareholderWalletAddressesAndNumberOfNFTshares(address (Vertex SOLO_NFT_n Owner_XRP_Public_Key) STRING, minted_by (Vertex: SOLO_NFT_n Issuer_blockchain_domain)  STRING, name (Vertex: SOLO_NFT_n NFT_Name) STRING) FOR GRAPH WorldBlockchainComputer {Brief steps: 1. Find current NFTshareholders wallet "address" (Vertex: SOLO_NFT_n Owner_XRP_Public_Key) which NFTshares "name" (Vertex: SOLO_NFT_n NFT_Name) were "minted by" (Vertex: SOLO_NFT_n Issuer_blockchain_domain) original wallet address of Company. 2. Display number of NFTshares per NFTshareholder wallet "address" (Vertex: SOLO_NFT_n Owner_XRP_Public_Key). 3. Find "external_link":"https://ipfs.io/ipfs/QmUDPT6K1ENmX8HJaBE6VBZXZi159zCUFAPK84s4ScbM5K" ...}```

`metadata.json:` [worldblockchaincomputer{.org .crypto} SmartContract{Smart NFTs} #0000001](https://ipfs.io/ipfs/bafybeicdybfshjsmtwkptpp2v32b24f55vj3qdts7q3i6suqpz3gftml54/metadata.json)

The symmetry between an AI neuron-axon network and the present Web3 IPO XRPL MATIC-SOLO Hooks SmartContract{SmartNFTshares} project is readily apparent looking at its TigerGraph vertice-edge design schema replication of the neuron-axon neurotransmission of the monetization of information. 

The real world impact being the placeholder 10,000 monkey NFT images now have a smart NFT human-readable to machine-readable crypto transaction utility - which the AI natural language processing systems such as **OpenAI**, **DeepMind**, **Minerva**, among others are all learning to assimilate into an emerging **AGI worldview** with all of the implications and consequences towards the emerging digital transactional representations of stocks, bonds, real estate smart contracts, mortgages, and all other debt instruments, patents, intellectual, and physical forms of personal property. 

## Securities Designation of SmartContract{SmartNFTshares}
**RESOLVED: The present Web3 IPO XRPL MATIC-SOLO Hooks SmartContract{SmartNFTshares} Network represents a COMPANY not a security and could be sold as such on OpenSea, whereas its individual {SmartNFTshares} represent SECURITIES and could be sold as such on the Sologenic DEX.**

If anyone including the nation's top security lawyers want to elaborate/dispute the above please feel free to do so in the comments, taking note of the fact the [Sologenic DEX is already trading over 40,000 stocks, commodities, ETFs, and securities from over 30 top global stock exchanges located in Europe, Asia, Oceania, and North America](https://www.securities.io/investing-in-sologenic-solo-everything-you-need-to-know/).

I first got the idea for human-readable.crypto domain name NFT owership while watching a @RippleXDev video hosted by @HammerToe with @yyolk demonstrating the RippleX html NFT minting UI, wherein as they explained, one field requires a URL to store the image. I had a few of those in stock from buying a number of Unstoppable Domains thinking they would be useful for something someday.
  
My experience with Devpost is it's a great platform for facilitating software development wherein the full-stack has worked flawlessly in the two projects I have been having success with.
